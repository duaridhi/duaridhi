# Search & Backend Engineer 👋

I design and build **high-performance search platforms and backend systems** using Java and modern distributed technologies.

With 14+ years of experience, I’ve worked on **petabyte-scale search**, **real-time data pipelines**, and **model-driven surveillance systems** in highly regulated environments. My work spans hands-on engineering, system design, and technical advisory for complex, data-intensive platforms.

I currently work as a **remote / freelance engineer and consultant**, helping teams design, build, and scale production-grade systems.
